Technical Plan: CISSP Tutor & Exam Platform (Embeddings + RAG)

1. Dependencies & Setup

Python (3.11+)

Libraries:

LangChain (pip install langchain)

ChromaDB (pip install chromadb)

PyMuPDF (pip install pymupdf)

HuggingFace Embeddings (pip install sentence-transformers)

Ollama (local LLaMA model)

2. Data Ingestion

Write a Python script to:

Scan a folder containing PDF books.

Extract text using PyMuPDF.

Chunk text into semantic units (~500 tokens per chunk, 100-token overlap).

Generate embeddings with HuggingFace's BAAI/bge-large-en.

Store embeddings in ChromaDB with metadata: {book_title, author, chunk_number}.

Automate periodic ingestion of new CISSP materials.

3. Retrieval Setup (RAG)

Use LangChain or custom logic:

Implement similarity search (top_k=5 initially).

Retrieve contexts based on user queries.

Pass retrieved contexts as prompt context to the LLM (Local LLaMA via Ollama).

4. Contradiction Detection & Handling

Implement logic to detect contradictions in retrieved contexts:

Compute cosine similarity or semantic difference between embeddings.

If contradictions detected (similarity < threshold), explicitly flag in response and return conflicting sources and answers clearly marked.

5. Tutoring System

Interactive Q&A interface:

Allow users to ask open-ended or specific topic questions.

The model provides comprehensive explanations using retrieved context, clearly explaining reasoning.

Optionally include follow-up prompts to clarify or deepen understanding.

Provide explanations with direct citations to sources.

Log user interactions and feedback to refine the adaptive learning model.

Adaptive learning:

Track user queries and identify patterns or knowledge gaps.

Suggest tailored reading or questions for improvement.

Periodically prompt the user with review questions on previously challenging topics using spaced repetition algorithms.

6. Question & Exam Interaction

Create API or CLI interface to:

Allow user input queries.

Return detailed answers with source references.

Implement exam mode (multiple-choice or short-answer).

Automatically grade responses based on stored correct answers and context-based generation.

Include analytics features to track user progress over time and identify broad trends or frequent difficulties.

7. Optional UI Integration

Front-end with Streamlit or Flask:

Minimal interface to input queries, select exam modes.

Display answers clearly with references to original book sources.

Allow real-time collaboration or chat functionality for users to discuss tricky concepts directly within the platform.

8. Deployment & Optimization

Dockerize application for easy deployment.

Optimize retrieval chunk size, overlap, and similarity thresholds iteratively for best results.

End Goal:

A self-contained CISSP tutoring & exam platform that uses embeddings and RAG to accurately answer questions, provide adaptive tutoring, detect contradictions across multiple sources, facilitate real-time collaboration, support dynamic content updates, and clearly present information with metadata-backed source referencing and detailed analytics.
